description: '`refined_type` is a library developed for Rust. It enhances your types, making them more robust and expanding the range of guarantees your applications can statically ensure.'

## Overview
You can create various rules for a certain type, such as phone numbers, addresses, times, and so on. Once you have established the rules, you can easily combine them.

Specifically, if you create rules for **non-empty strings** and **strings composed only of alphabets**, you do not need to redefine a new rule for **non-empty strings composed only of alphabets**.

All rules can be arbitrarily combined and extended as long as the target type matches.

Enjoy a wonderful type life!

## Installation
```shell
cargo add refined_type
```

Or add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
refined_type = "x.x.x"
```
