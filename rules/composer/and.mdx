"description": '`And` is a rule composer that combines the results of two rules. Both rules must be satisfied for the `And` rule to be satisfied.'

## Overview
To create a rule that is only satisfied when both a specific rule and another rule are met, you can use the `And` Rule Composer.
This composer allows you to combine multiple rules in a way that the overall condition is fulfilled only when each individual rule within the composition is satisfied.

## Example
For example, let’s consider a case where we only allow **even integers** within the range of **0 to 100**.

```rust
type Target = Refined<And![EvenRuleU8, MinMaxRuleU8<0, 100>]>;
```

In this example, the `Target` type is defined as a refined type that only accepts even integers within the range of 0 to 100.

Let’s see how this rule works in practice.

```rust
fn and_example() -> Result<(), Error<u8>> {
    let target = Target::new(50)?;
    assert_eq!(target.into_value(), 50);

    let target = Target::new(51);
    assert!(target.is_err());

    Ok(())
}
```
