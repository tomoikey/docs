## Overview
To create a rule that is only satisfied when a specific rule is not met, you can use the `Not` Rule Composer.
This composer allows you to negate the result of another rule.

## Example
For example, let’s consider a case where we only allow all numbers except **50**.

```rust
type Target = Refined<Not<EqualRuleU8<50>>>;
```

In this example, the `Target` type is defined as a refined type that only accepts numbers except **50**.

Let’s see how this rule works in practice.

```rust
fn not_example() -> Result<(), Error<u8>> {
    let target = Target::new(49)?;
    assert_eq!(target.into_value(), 49);

    let target = Target::new(50);
    assert!(target.is_err());

    Ok(())
}
```
