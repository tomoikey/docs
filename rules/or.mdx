"description": '`Or` is a rule composer that combines the results of two rules. If either rule is satisfied, the `Or` rule is satisfied.'

## Overview
To create a rule that is satisfied when either a specific rule or another rule is met, you can use the `Or` Rule Composer.
This composer allows you to combine multiple rules in a way that the overall condition is fulfilled when at least one of the individual rules within the composition is satisfied.

## Example
For example, let’s consider a case where we allow integers that are less than **10** or greater than **50**.

```rust
type Target = Refined<Or![LessRuleU8<10>, GreaterRuleU8<50>]>;
```

In this example, the `Target` type is defined as a refined type that only accepts integers that are less than **10** or greater than **50**.

Let’s see how this rule works in practice.

```rust
fn or_example() -> Result<(), Error<u8>> {
    let target = Target::new(5)?;
    assert_eq!(target.into_value(), 5);

    let target = Target::new(10);
    assert!(target.is_err());

    let target = Target::new(50);
    assert!(target.is_err());

    let target = Target::new(51)?;
    assert_eq!(target.into_value(), 51);

    Ok(())
}
```
